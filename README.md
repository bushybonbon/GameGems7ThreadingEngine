"# GameGems7ThreadingEngine"
Code from Game Gems 7 - I originally used the fundamentals from this system
for Blue Fangs Threading Library a number of years ago. I worked at Blue Fang
for 4 years or more and contributed to World of Zoo as a Senior AI developer -
writing systems such as our pathfinding system for static and dynamic
environments, lot's of physics work, game coding, etc...
